AI Clinical Data Pipeline for ENT Trials

Structured 500+ patient records from allergy immunotherapy & sinus trials (Xolair/Nucala/Dupixent) for ML training using 11+ years CRC expertise

Pipeline Overview
Raw ENT Trial Data → Data Cleaning → GCP-Compliant Structuring → ML-Ready Dataset

Clinical Data Sources (Real Experience)
- Allergy immunotherapy trials (Prick/intradermal testing, vial preparation)
- Biologic drug trials: Xolair, Nucala, Dupixent (nasal polyps) 
- Device trials: Sinuva implants (chronic sinusitis)
- Sources: ENT Practice Houston, DaVita Clinical Research, LQ Research

Data Quality Standards Applied
FDA/GCP compliant Source Data Verification
CRF/CTMS data extraction & query resolution  
Temperature monitoring & IP accountability logs
Patient outcomes & adverse events documentation

Tech Stack (In Progress)
- Python/Pandas - Data cleaning & structuring
- "AI for Medicine" - Coursera (DeepLearning.AI)
- Future: eDC platforms, digital biomarkers, remote SDV

CRC → Remote CRA Transition Project
Target: Entry-level Remote/In-House CRA specializing in AI/digital clinical trials
